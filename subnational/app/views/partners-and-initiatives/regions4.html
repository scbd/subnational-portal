        About Regions4
    </h2>
    <p>
        <a href="https://www.regions4.org/"><b>The Regions4</b></a> is the global voice of regional governments (states, regions and provinces) before UN negotiations, European Union initiatives and global discussions in the fields of climate change, biodiversity and sustainable development. Regions4 was established in 2002 at the World Summit in Johannesburg as the Network of Regional Governments for Sustainable Development â€“ nrg4SD. In 2019, it became Regions4, and now represents 41 regional governments from 21 countries in 4 continents.
    </p>
    <!-- <p>
        As part of its objectives, nrg4SD: promotes sustainable development at the level of subnational government around the Globe; acts as the voice and representative of subnational governments at global level in the field of sustainable development; seeks a wider recognition at international level of the importance of the commitment of subnational governments towards sustainable development; encourages the understanding, partnerships, projects and expertise exchange among its members, and also between them and other major international stakeholders. The Network focuses on 3 main thematic areas &ndash; climate change, biodiversity, water resources and sanitation &ndash; and the cross-cutting theme of sustainable development.
    </p>
    <p>
        Since 2010, nrg4SD takes part in the Global Partnership on Local and Subnational Action for Biodiversity and, following from Decision X/22, is collaborating with the Secretariat and its partners in order to facilitate the implementation of the Plan of Action and the establishment of an Advisory Committee of Subnational Governments for Biodiversity. In doing so, nrg4SD is also working with all the members of the global partnership, and in particular with ICLEI - Local Governments for Sustainability, who are key partners to the Convention for the implementation of the Plan of Action. In line with this, nrg4SD established a Working Group on the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) in order to:
