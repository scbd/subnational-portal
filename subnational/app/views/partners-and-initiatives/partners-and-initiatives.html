			           <p>The Global Partnership on Local and Subnational Action for Biodiversity was established in 2008 with the goal of bringing together all the relevant networks and initiatives involved, directly or indirectly, in implementing the Convention on Biological Diversity. Membership is open to all. Within the Global Partnership, advisory committees of cities and of subnational governments provide specific direction based on hands-on experience, while a group of urban biodiversity researchers, URBIO, add scientific expertise to the Partnership. <a href="#" ng-click="showmoreless()"><span ng-show="!showme">More....</span><span ng-show="showme">Less....</span></a></p>

			           <p><b>Advisory Committee of Cities </b><br />
			           The Advisory Committee of Cities to the Global Partnership on Local and Subnational Action for Biodiversity consists of representatives of cities that have hosted recent meetings of the biennial Conference of the Parties to the CBD (Hyderabad, Nagoya, Bonn, Curitiba), as well as the host city of the Secretariat, Montreal, and other cities that have been particularly active in the area of subnational implementation (Montpellier, Mexico City). The island-state Singapore has, in addition, played a continued supporting role to the Advisory Committee. The Advisory Committee of Cities has shown initiative not only in its advisory capacity but also through example: led by Mexico City, an exhibition of urban biodiversity in all the cities of the Committee was compiled and displayed at CBD COP 11 in Hyderabad, and at local venues. In addition Curitiba, Bonn and Nagoya have hosted meetings of the Global Partnership.</p>

						<p><b>Advisory Committee of Subnational Governments </b><br />
						The Advisory Committee of Subnational Governments to the Global Partnership on Local and Subnational Action for Biodiversity consists of representatives of subnational governments that have hosted recent meetings of the biennial Conference of the Parties to the CBD (Gangwon Province, Andhra Pradesh State, Aichi Prefecture, Paraná State), as well as the host subnational government of the Secretariat, Quebec, and other subnational governments that have been particularly active in the area of subnational implementation (Catalonia, São Paulo State). The Advisory Committee of Subnational Governments has shown initiative not only in its advisory capacity but also through example: led by Catalonia and Quebec, an action plan of projects is being compiled and implemented, creating a model for other subnational governments to follow. In addition Catalonia, Gangwon Province and Paraná State have hosted meetings of the Global Partnership, and Quebec is planning to host the next meeting of the Advisory Committee of Subnational Governments in 2015.</p>

						<p><b>URBIO</b><br />
						The group “Urban Biodiversity and Design” (URBIO) consists of researchers with a focus on urban biodiversity, affiliated with the Global Partnership on Local and Subnational Action for Biodiversity. URBIO have convened conferences on urban biodiversity research and design in parallel with the past three and upcoming biennial Conference of the Parties to the CBD, the outcomes of which have been fed into summits on cities and subnational governments for biodiversity, also in parallel with the COP. URBIO are currently compiling a research agenda, with broad input, indicating which areas of urban biodiversity research are most urgent and necessary.
