    <h3>
        The First, Second &amp; Third Expert Workshops on the Development of the City Biodiversity Index held in Singapore
    </h3>
    <p>
        The framework of the City Biodiversity Index was formulated by the participants at the First Expert Workshop on the Development of the City Biodiversity Index in February 2009. A Technical Task Force was set up to fine-tune the indicators of the City Biodiversity Index and to make it user-friendly. After a preliminary assessment of their data availability and feedback by several cities worldwide, the indicators and scoring system were further improved upon and the first version of the User&#39;s Manual for this Index was developed.
    </p>
    <p>
        The Second Expert Workshop was held in July, 2010. A total of 32 experts on urban biodiversity conservation and planning, as well as representatives from 7 cities worldwide, attended the workshop. The participants shared the results of the test-bedding of the Index and discussed the further revision of the indicators, to make the indicator set more practical and user-friendly. <a href="http://www.cbd.int/doc/?meeting=EWDCBI-02">The workshop documents</a> and <a href="http://www.cbd.int/authorities/informationresources.shtml">presentations by the participants </a>are available online.
    </p>
    <p>
        As the result of discussions at the Second Expert Workshop and the following thorough consideration to the revised set of indicators, the revised version of <a href="http://www.cbd.int/authorities/doc/User's Manual-for-the-City-Biodiversity-Index18April2012.pdf"><b>the User&rsquo;s Manual for the City Biodiversity Index</b> </a>has been developed.
    </p>
    <p>
        The <a href="http://www.cbd.int/authorities/importantevents/">third workshop</a> will be held in Singapore on 11-12 October 2011, and will be followed by a meeting on the City Biodiversity Outlook I on 13 October 2011.

        Presentation
    </h3>
    <p>
        In May 2008, Mr. Mah Bow Tan, Minister of National Development of Singapore, proposed the CBD-led development of the city biodiversity index at the 9th Meeting of the Conference of the Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD). To follow-up on this, the Secretariat of the CBD and the National Parks Board of Singapore (NParks) jointly organised the Technical Expert Workshop on The Singapore Index on Cities&#39; Biodiversity in Singapore from 10 February to 12 February 2009. A total of seventeen technical experts on biodiversity indicators as well as city executives and city representatives responsible for implementation and/or management of biodiversity and urban projects and programmes attended this workshop in the development of the index as an evaluation tool. Once the evaluation tool has been designed, cities were invited to test its applicability. The Index was be presented at the 10th Meeting of the Conference of the Parties to the CBD and is part of the Plan of Action endorsed by COP10.
