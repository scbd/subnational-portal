				<p>Subnational (including local) governments are governance units at various levels, within countries, and are accountable to national governments to varying degrees. They are of profound importance in supporting the implementation of the CBD because they are responsible for the action that must follow many of the decisions made by national governments. They set local environment and development policy, are responsible for land-use planning, and develop and manage infrastructure that depend on and/or impact biodiversity, such as water and waste management systems. Since 2007, the Earth’s population has been mostly urban, and cities are almost always administered by subnational governments. Cities have the additional distinction of a disproportionately large ecological footprint, as well as disproportionate potential for resource-use efficiency and other environmental solutions. Actions at the local level can have direct results that can convince others of the need to get involved, while sending a message to higher levels of governments. 
			    </p>
				<p>At the same time biodiversity, one of the world’s most critical resources, is threatened as never before, with serious consequences climate change, availability of water, food, and benefits of many other ecosystem services.  Biodiversity is first and foremost a local i. It is through our daily activities that we impact biodiversity and it is through local actions that the situation can be addressed mefficiently. Humankind depends on healthy ecosystems to survive, and producers and consumers at the local level can take direct actionprotect these invaluable resources. Recognizing these issues and with the support of various organizations such as ICLEI – Local Governments for Sustainability, the Parties to the CBD are increasingly seeking to engage with subnational governments to accelerate and improve implementation of the Convention.
