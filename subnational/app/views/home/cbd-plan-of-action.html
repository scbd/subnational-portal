		<p>CBD COP 12 in Pyeongchang, Republic of Korea, in 2014 was the fourth consecutive meeting of the Conference of the Parties to the CBD at which Parties adopted a decision (<a href='http://www.cbd.intwww.cbd.int/decision/cop/default.shtml?id=13372' target='_self'>decision XII/9</a>), on cities and subnational governments, and the first with a focus on sustainable urbanization. </p>
		<p><a href='http://www.cbd.int/decisions/cop/?m=cop-09' target='_self'>Decision IX/28</a>, adopted at COP 9 in Bonn in 2008, was the first decision on cities and subnational governments to be adopted under a United Nations multilateral environmental agreement. <a href='http://www.cbd.int/decision/cop/default.shtml?id=12288' target='_self'>Decision X/22</a>, adopted at COP 10 in Nagoya in 2010, included a Plan of Action on Subnational Governments, Cities and Other Local Authorities for Biodiversity (2011-2020), mirroring the Strategic Plan for Biodiversity 2011-2020, which guides the Convention for the decade. <a href='http://www.cbd.int/decision/cop/default.shtml?id=13169' target='_self'>Decision XI/8</a>, adopted at CBD COP 11 in Hyderabad in 2012, requested the Executive Secretary to support the activities of the Global Partnership, as well as inviting Parties to develop and support tools and initiatives that facilitate the subnational implementation of the Convention.</p>
		<p>The Plan of Action on Subnational Governments, Cities and Other Local Authorities for Biodiversity (2011-2020), endorsed with the adoption of decision X/22, provides suggestions to Parties on how to mobilize and coordinate local actions on biodiversity, to bring national strategies and plans into the local context. A set of objectives, monitoring and reporting guidelines, as well as suggested activities for implementation are presented in the plan, as well as an institutional framework for optimizing synergies between Parties, UN and development agencies, NGOs and networks of cities. The Plan of Action calls for dissemination of best practices to better promote local efforts and to facilitate communications between all levels of government, and for those governments to work together in developing their respective biodiversity strategies and action plans. As a way to facilitate exchanges, cities & subnational governments who wish to share their experiences in developing their strategies and action plans, especially when done in collaboration with their national governments, are invited to submit their contribution to <a href='mailto:secretariat@cbd.int'>secretariat@cbd.int</a> with the subject line “cities & subnational governments”.</p>
