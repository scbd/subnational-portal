		<h1>How to Get Involved</h1>
		<h2>Overview</h2>
		<p>
			Local authorities represent the level of government closest to people thus their involvement in the implementation of the Convention and its 2010 target is of crucial importance. As land-use planners, policy-makers, and developers and managers of local infrastructure, they have a critical role to play in promoting sustainable development and its biodiversity components. As community leaders, they have a responsibility to raise public awareness about the importance of biodiversity. In addition, actions at the local level can have direct results that can convince others of the need to get involved, while sending a message to higher levels of governments.</p>
		<p>
			The establishment of a Global Partnership on Cities and Biodiversity was proposed during the Curitiba Meeting on Cities and Biodiversity in March 2007 to support cities in the sustainable management of their biodiversity resources, to assist cities to implement practices that support national, regional and international strategies, plans, and agendas on biodiversity, and to learn from existing initiatives. Click <a href="/subnational/partners-and-initiatives/global-partnership"><b>here</b></a> for more information on the Global Partnership on Cities and Biodiversity, which was formally launched in October 2008 at the IUCN World Conservation Congress.</p>
		<p>
			Following the adoption of the Plan of Action on Subnational Governments, Cities and Other Local Authorities for Biodiversity and the inclusion of partners from the subnational levels of governments, the partnership was officially renamed Global Partnership on Local and Subnational Action for Biodiversity at the occasion of the <a href="http://www.cbd.int/doc/press/2011/pr-2011-09-15-gcbo-en.pdf " target="_self">Second Meeting on the Implementation of the Plan of Action</a> which took place in the City of Bonn, Germany, on 5-6 September 2011.</p>
		<h2>Local authorities and COP decisions</h2>
		<p>
			The Convention’s comprehensive and integrated approach to biodiversity conservation and management acts as a framework within which Parties can define national policies, which are subsequently implemented at the national, regional and local level. It also acts as a framework within which local authorities can define local policies and regulations. Guiding for these policies lies notably in COP decisions. For example, <a href="http://www.cbd.int/decision/cop/default.shtml?id=7148" target="_self">decision V/6</a> presents the adopted Description, Principles, and Operational Guidelines for the Ecosystem Approach, a powerful tool for landscape-level planning. These elements were developed further in <a href="http://www.cbd.int/decision/cop/default.shtml?id=7748" target="_self">decision VII/11</a>. At COP 9 in Bonn, Germany in May 2008, the Parties discussed the role of local authorities in the implementation of the Convention and for the first time ever adopted a decision on cities and biodiversity, <a href="http://www.cbd.int/doc/decisions/cop-09/cop-09-dec-28-en.pdf" target="_self">Decision IX/28</a>. This decision encourages the 191 Parties to the Convention to recognize the role of cities in national strategies and plans, and invites Parties to support and assist cities in implementing the Convention at local level. In 2010, <a href="http://www.cbd.int/doc/decisions/cop-10/cop-10-dec-22-en.pdf" target="_self">Decision X/22 and its annex The Plan of Action on Sub-National Governments, Cities and Local Authorities on Biodiversity</a> was adopted by the tenth meeting of the Conference of the Parties in October, in Nagoya, Japan.</p>

		<h2>Share your experience</h2>
		<p>
			If you wish to share your unique experience regarding the implementation of the Convention, thus participating in the exchange of best practices and awareness raising of biodiversity issues, we invite you to send us a case study, which will be included on the Secretariat's website. We encourage you to look at the <a href="/subnational/resources/case-studies">CASE STUDIES</a> subsection to become familiar with the themes and the procedure for the submission of case studies. Cities are also invited to submit information on their experiences in implementing the Plan of Action on Subnational Governments, Cities and Other Local Authorities, which will posted on the <a href="/subnational/resources/strategies-and-action-plans">corresponding web page</a>.</p>

			Cities are celebrating IDB!</h3>
		<h4>
			Celebrating IDB!
		</h4>
		<p>
			The United Nations proclaimed May 22 <a href="http://www.cbd.int/idb/ " target="_self">The International Day for Biological Diversity (IDB)</a> to increase understanding and awareness of biodiversity issues. Every year, country Parties and their partners all over the world are taking part in IDB celebrations, including local governments.</p>
		<p>
			The theme for the International Day for Biodiversity (IDB) in 2014 was <b>Island Biodiversity</b>, recognizing that <b>Islands</b> and their surrounding near-shore marine areas constitute unique ecosystems often comprising many plant and animal species that are endemic—found nowhere else on Earth.</p>
		<p>
			<b>Water and Biodiversity</b> was chosen in 2013 and supported by the United Nations designation of the <a href="http://www.un.org/waterforlifedecade/">International Decade for Action ‘Water for Life’ 2005-2015</a>. </p>
		<p>
			<b>Marine and Coastal Biodiversity</b> was theme for IDB in 2012 and provided the Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) and everyone interested in marine life, the opportunity to raise awareness of the issue and increase practical action.</p>
		<p>
			In 2011 the theme of IDB, '<b>Forest Biodiversity</b>', corresponds to the International Year of Forests. Click <a href="http://www.cbd.int/idb/2011" target="_self">here</a> to learn more about the 2011 celebrations.</p>
		<p>
			In 2010, the theme was <b>Biodiversity, Development and Poverty Alleviation</b>, and the Day contributed to the celebrations of the International Year of Biodiversity! Designation of IDB 2010 on the theme of development provides Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) and other organizations dealing with development, opportunity to raise awareness of the issue and increase practical action.
