        MediverCities - What is it ?
    </h2>
    <div style="text-align: justify;">
        MediverCities is an open network for Mediterranean national and subnational governments, local authorities, cities and their partners (academia or scientific institutions) dedicated to the implementation of the Convention on Biological Diversity and related multilateral regional agreements. It is an initiative by the Mayor of <a href="http://www.montpellier.fr/">Montpellier</a> and <a href="http://www.iclei.org/">ICLEI - Local Governments for Sustainability</a> with the support of the Secretariat of the Convention on Biological Diversity and the financial support of the Japan Biodiversity Fund.<br />
        Designed after a series of workshops and consultative meetings, the network aims at facilitating the local implementation of the National Biodiversity Strategies and Action Plans of all Mediterranean Parties to the CBD (22 countries), as well as other international or regional agreements related to the conservation and the sustainable use of biodiversity and to the fair and equitable sharing of the benefits of its utilization. For instance, MediverCities is planned to collaborate with the Mediterranean Action Plan in order to facilitate the implementation of the Barcelona Convention on the Protection of the Mediterranean Sea against Pollution.<br />
        <br />

        The mandate
    </h2>
    <div style="text-align: justify;">
        The tenth meeting of the Conference of the Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity, through <a href="http://www.cbd.int/decision/cop/?id=12288">Decision X/22</a>, endorsed the Plan of Action on Subnational Governments, Cities and other Local Authorities for Biodiversity. Since then, the Secretariat of the Convention has been liaising with Cities and local authorities to assess the potential of implementation of and interest for the Convention by networks at the local level. The projects and activities of MediverCities were developed over two meetings held in Montpellier, France, respectively in <a href="http://www.cbd.int/doc/?meeting=IPA-SNGCOLA-01">2011</a> and <a href="http://www.cbd.int/doc/?meeting=NBSAPRW-CLAMED-01">2012</a>. During the latter, on 19 January 2012, Ms. Mandroux, Mayor of Montpellier, proposed to launch the Mediterranean network of cities engaged for biodiversity entitled &quot;MediverCities&rdquo;.<br />
        The network has been presented at the Conference of the Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity, in October 2012 in Hyderabad, at the <a href="http://www.iclei.org/index.php?id=12919">Cities for Life Summit</a>.
