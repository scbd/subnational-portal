	<p>
	    Taking full advantage of the immense potential of local authorities to contribute to the implementation of the Convention, the Global Partnership and a number of CBD Parties proposed to complement COP decision IX/28, adopted in Bonn, with a broader Plan of Action on Subnational Governments, Cities and Other Local Authorities for Biodiversity. Building on the experiences and lessons learned by leading cities and Parties, the plan provides suggestions to Parties on how to mobilize and coordinate local actions on biodiversity, to take CBD issues to urban residents, and to bring national strategies and plans into the urban context. A set of objectives, monitoring and reporting guidelines, as well as suggested activities for implementation are presented in the plan, as well as an appropriate institutional framework for optimizing synergies between Parties, UN and development agencies, NGOs and networks of cities. Publications such as the ICLEI LAB manual for local authorities and the SCBD/UN-HABITAT guidebook.

	    Best Practices: Implementation of the Plan of Action at the Subnational and Local levels
	</h3>
	<p>
	    The Plan of Action calls for dissemination of best practices to better promote local efforts and to facilitate communications between all levels of government, and for those governments to work together in developing their respective biodiversity strategies and action plans. As a way to facilitate exchanges, sub-national and local governments who wish to share their experiences in developing their strategies and action plans in collaboration with CBD Parties (or other governments) are invited to submit their contribution to : secretariat@cbd.int.
