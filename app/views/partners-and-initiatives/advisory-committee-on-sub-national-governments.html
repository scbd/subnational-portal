		    Advisory Committee on Subnational Governments
		</h2>
		<h3>
		    Introduction
		</h3>
		<p>
		    Better &nbsp;decisions and actions for biodiversity need to be made at all levels of governments, for the effective and efficient implementation of the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) and its 2011-2020 Strategic Plan on Biodiversity. The first Aichi target for the new CBD Strategic Plan recognizes that: &ldquo;by 2020, at the latest, biodiversity values have been integrated into national and local development and poverty reduction strategies&rdquo;.
		</p>
		<p>
		    As public administration authorities which function between the national and local governments (such as cities, towns and villages), subnational governments (such as States, Regions, Provinces, counties, territories and other intermediate levels of government) have important roles to play in articulating governance in all Parties of the Convention, though their jurisdiction varies from country to country. Through their mandates on environmental protection and sustainable development promotion, land-use planning and landscape management, licensing of large developments, infrastructure investment, research and innovation or financial and fiscal/incentives policy, subnational governments can play a key role in integrating biodiversity, and in developing Subnnational Biodiversity Strategies and Action Plans (SNBSAPs) in line with their respective National Biodiversity Strategies and Action Plans (NBSAPs), in their turn also supporting the development of the appropriate Local Biodiversity Strategies and Action Plans (LBSAPs).
		</p>
		<p>
		    Decision X/22 endorsed the &ldquo;Plan of Action on Subnational Governments, Cities and other Local Authorities for Biodiversity 2011-2020&rdquo; and provided national governments with a set of guidelines to follow at their discretion in support of local and sub-regional implementation of the Convention. The Plan of Action invites the CBD Parties to involve subnational governments, cities and other local authorities when revising their national biodiversity strategies and action plans. Additionally, this Plan refers to a formation of advisory committees of cities and of subnational governments which will provide input and support to the Plan.
		</p>
		<p>
		    In response to and in parallel to the development of the Plan of Action and of the Global Partnership on Local and Subnational Action on Biodiversity, recognition of &nbsp;the &nbsp;important contribution of &nbsp;subnational governments &nbsp;in the CBD has been increasing. At COP 10, on 22 October, a side-event on &nbsp;the role of subnational governments in the implementation of the Convention attracted 75 participants. The Governor of Uppsala and representatives from Aichi, Ishikawa &nbsp;and Hyogo Prefectures in Japan, the &nbsp;State of Paran√°, and the United Nations University (UNU), took the opportunity &nbsp;of &nbsp;exchanging experiences of best practice related to biodiversity management at subnational level and success stories of collaboration between different levels of governments.
		</p>
		<p>
		    Also, international or regional networks of subnational governments are &nbsp;active &nbsp;in promoting &nbsp;sustainable development and environmental conservation and in advocating for increased recognition of subnational governments as a key player. The Network of Regional Governments for Sustainable Development, (nrg4SD),an international organization representing subnational governments at the global level and focusing in particular in the areas of biodiversity, climate change and water resources &amp; sanitation, has agreed to set up, at its last General Assembly in 2011 in Quebec, Canada, a working group on supporting the CBD.Paragraph 8 of section E on Partnerships and coordination mechanism of &nbsp;decision &nbsp;X/22 specifies nrg4SD as a key partner for the Advisory Committee on Subnational Governments.&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>
		    Also in June 2010, the Committee of the Regions (CoR), the European Union&rsquo;s (EU) assembly of subnational and local representatives adopted its opinion on &ldquo;EU and international biodiversity policy beyond 2010&rdquo; which emphasizes &nbsp;that &nbsp;efforts at involving local and subnational governments need to be increased to halt biodiversity loss. Associations of subnational governments, such as the &ldquo;Association of Regions of France&rdquo; (ARF) &nbsp;are also willing to contribute, as is IUCN&rsquo;s French Committee (supported by several regions)Considering the success of a similar mechanism set up for cities (the Advisory Committee on Cities and Biodiversity) and subnational governments&rsquo; critical, complementary and distinct role in the implementation of the Convention, this paper aims to stipulate the basic terms of reference on an advisory committee of subnational leaders mentioned in the Plan of Action on Subnational Governments, Cities and other Local Authorities for Biodiversity 2011-2020, for discussion at the upcoming meeting of Subnational Governments to be held in Curitiba, Brazil, from 24 to 27 April 2012, at the invitation of Governor Beto Richa of Parana State.&nbsp;

		</p>
		<p>
		    (b) Promote collaboration between different levels of governments and coordinate efforts by subnational governments in support of the CBD Plan of Action on Subnational, Cities and other Local Authorities for Biodiversity 2011-2020 by sharing information on the Global Partnership and its members.
